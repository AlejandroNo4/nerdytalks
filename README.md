# Nerdy Talks 

> This is a rails app created as the RoR capstone for the Microverse‚Äôs main curriculum.

I made this project for learning proposes, to implement all the learned skills during the RoR course. It is a ‚Äúclone‚Äù of Twitter, but with basic functions.

Instead of Twitter, I called it ‚ÄúNerdy Talks‚Äù. Space where everybody can share ideas, or in this case ‚Äútalks‚Äù about what we all love. Nerdy stuff.

Go ahead. Try it by yourself!
